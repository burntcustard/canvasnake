# Canvasnake
This is a snake versus snake game, with local multiplayer, or player vs AI, or AI vs AI, made from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas.

The project was originally for a module in my 2nd year of university, CI213 Intelligent systems. The version that was submitted for that can be found here (TODO: Replace with link to v0.1-original).

For my final year module, CI342 Applied Intelligent Systems, the old snake game will be used as a base for further development. The plan is to replace the primitive AI currently in the game with a snake that uses genetic algorithms and deep learning to figure out how to play the game itself, with minimal user input or prior knowledge.

The old code is ~1800 lines of JavaScript in 1 file. It'll be refactored using ECMAScript 2015 features, with the aim of making it more readable, and more accomodating to swappable AI modules so that AIs using different neural networks, and the original old AI, can be trained and tested against each other.

Other work that is non-university-course-related is planned, like UI improvements, and fixing the game's QR code logo to direct properly to burnt.io/canvasnake.
